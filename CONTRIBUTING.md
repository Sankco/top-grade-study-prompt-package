## ðŸ“Œ How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use the **Bug Report** template for problems you encounter.  
- Use the **Feature Request** template for new ideas.  
- For **Peer Review**, use the dedicated template to share prompt runs and feedback.

### 2. Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)
- Fork the repository and create a new branch (`feature/...`, `fix/...`).
- Make sure your PR clearly explains:
  - **What** you changed  
  - **Why** you changed it  
  - **How** it was tested (if applicable)
- Link any related Issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #12`).

### 3. Code & Content Standards
- Keep prompts **course-agnostic** and **rubric-aligned**.  
- Follow the **PAUSE/STOP** flow conventions in overlay and modules.  
- Add examples (`examples/`) when introducing new functionality.  
- Update documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) if your PR affects them.

2. **Generated Output** (results from running the prompt).  
3. **Reviewer Notes** (what worked well, what needs fixing).
